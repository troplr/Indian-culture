                    Often known as the ‘Mother Of All Martial Arts’, this 3000-year old art form originating from Kerala, draws inspiration from the raw power and sinuous strength of majestic animal forms - the lion, tiger, elephant, wild boar, snake and crocodile. It has lately emerged in a new avatar as a source of inspiration for self-expression in dance forms - both traditional and contemporary, in theater, in fitness and in movies too!

                    A traditional stick-martial art form from South India, the word ‘Silam’ (in Tamil) stands for hills and ‘Mambam’ (the Marhat word for bamboo) stands for bamboo from the hills; these sticks are usually found on the hills in that particular region. The salient parts of it are the very well-structured techniques, deeply articulated to each other, a lot of footwork, the fluency of play, and some fighting strategies.

                    Originating from the state of Punjab, Gatka was developed as a self-defense mechanism by the Sikhs. It was a battle technique created by the Sikh warriors during the martial period of the great Sikh Gurus. It is a style of stick fighting between two or more practitioners, with wooden sticks (called Soti) intended to simulate swords. In Gatka, the "Stick" and "Farri" are also used to substitute the sword and shield respectively for practice and safety purposes. Gatka is a unique art form to defend and display fighting skills and exercise self-control, which is the best part of this time-tested martial art.

                    A lathi is basically a six to eight foot long bamboo stick tipped with a metal blunt. The lathi is used by swinging it back and forth like a sword. The metal blunt is an optional part for a lathi. It is the Indian police’s most used crowd control device! When referring to the weapon itself, a lathi could be considered the world’s oldest weapon. Wielding the lathi involves giving quick lethal blows to the opponent and defending opponent attacks by using the lathi as a shield. A lathial needs to be quick and precise and a good lathial must be able to fight with lathis of different lengths and thicknesses.
